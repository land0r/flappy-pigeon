# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the cloud rendering system in Flappy Pigeon to create more realistic, visually appealing clouds that better complement the game's aesthetic. The current cloud implementation uses simple overlapping circles with low opacity, which appears scratchy and unrealistic. This enhancement will implement more sophisticated cloud rendering with better shapes, gradients, and visual depth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see realistic and visually appealing clouds in the background, so that the game environment feels more immersive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game renders the background THEN the system SHALL display clouds with smooth, organic shapes instead of simple circles
2. WHEN clouds are rendered THEN the system SHALL use gradient fills to create depth and volume
3. WHEN multiple clouds are displayed THEN the system SHALL vary their sizes, positions, and opacity for visual diversity
4. WHEN the game is running THEN clouds SHALL maintain consistent visual quality across all game states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the clouds to have subtle movement or animation, so that the sky feels alive and dynamic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is in playing state THEN clouds SHALL have subtle horizontal movement at different speeds
2. WHEN clouds move off-screen THEN the system SHALL seamlessly wrap them to the other side
3. WHEN clouds are animated THEN the movement SHALL be smooth and not distract from gameplay
4. WHEN the game is paused THEN cloud animation SHALL also pause

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cloud system to be performant and maintainable, so that it doesn't impact game performance or code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering clouds THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance
2. WHEN the cloud system is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the existing code architecture patterns
3. WHEN clouds are rendered THEN the system SHALL use efficient canvas operations
4. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the cloud implementation SHALL be easily configurable through GameConfig
