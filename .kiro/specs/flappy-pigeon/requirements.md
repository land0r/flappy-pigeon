## Introduction

Flappy Pigeon is a web-based 2D side-scrolling game inspired by Flappy Bird, featuring a pigeon as the main character. The game will be built using HTML5 Canvas and TypeScript for simplicity and broad browser compatibility. Players control a pigeon that must navigate through gaps between pipes by tapping or clicking to make the pigeon flap its wings and gain altitude, while gravity constantly pulls it down.
