  - Implement basic game loop with requestAnimationFrame
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4_

- [x] 2. Implement core game engine and state management
  - Create GameEngine class with game state enum and state transitions
  - Implement game loop methods (update, render, handleInput)
  - Add basic input event listeners for mouse clicks and keyboard
  - Create simple state-based rendering (menu, playing, game over screens)
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Create pigeon character with physics
  - Implement Pigeon class with position, velocity, and rotation properties
  - Add gravity physics that constantly pulls pigeon downward
  - Implement flap mechanism that applies upward velocity on input
  - Create basic rectangular rendering for pigeon with rotation
  - Add boundary collision detection for top and bottom screen edges
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Implement pipe obstacle system
  - Create Pipe class with top/bottom pipe segments and gap positioning
  - Implement pipe movement from right to left across screen
  - Create PipeManager class to handle pipe spawning at regular intervals
  - Add pipe cleanup when they move off-screen to prevent memory leaks
  - Implement basic rectangular rendering for pipe obstacles
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Add collision detection between pigeon and pipes
  - Implement Rectangle interface and collision detection utility functions
  - Add collision checking between pigeon bounds and pipe bounds
  - Integrate collision detection into game loop to trigger game over state
  - Test collision accuracy with different pigeon positions and rotations
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [x] 6. Implement scoring system
  - Create ScoreManager class to track current score and high score
  - Add logic to detect when pigeon successfully passes through pipe gap
  - Increment score when pigeon passes pipes and prevent double-counting
  - Implement high score persistence using localStorage
  - Display current score during gameplay and final score on game over
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Add visual enhancements and animations
  - Implement pigeon wing flapping animation with sprite rotation
  - Add smooth pigeon rotation based on velocity (diving/climbing angles)
  - Create background rendering with simple gradient or pattern
  - Enhance UI rendering with better fonts and visual styling
  - Add visual feedback for game state transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 8. Implement audio system and sound effects
  - Create AudioManager class to handle sound loading and playback
  - Add flapping sound effect that plays when pigeon flaps wings
  - Implement scoring sound effect when pigeon passes through pipes
  - Add game over sound effect when collision occurs
  - Include mute/unmute functionality and handle audio loading errors
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Add responsive design and mobile support
  - Implement canvas resizing logic to maintain aspect ratio
  - Add touch event handling for mobile devices
  - Ensure game remains playable on different screen sizes
  - Test and adjust game element sizes for mobile screens
  - _Requirements: 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Implement pause functionality
  - Add pause/unpause game state and input handling
  - Ensure all game elements stop updating when paused
  - Display pause indicator and instructions on screen
  - Handle browser tab visibility changes to auto-pause
  - _Requirements: 4.5_

- [ ] 11. Performance optimization and testing
  - Implement frame rate monitoring and performance metrics
  - Optimize canvas rendering to maintain 60 FPS target
  - Add error handling for canvas context and audio failures
  - Test game performance with multiple pipes and extended gameplay
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 12. Final integration and polish
  - Integrate all systems together and test complete gameplay flow
  - Add final visual polish and UI improvements
  - Test all game states and transitions work correctly
  - Verify all requirements are met through comprehensive testing
  - Create build process for production deployment
  - _Requirements: All requirements verification_
